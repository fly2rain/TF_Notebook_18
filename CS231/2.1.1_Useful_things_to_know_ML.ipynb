    "    * This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond.\n",
    "    * Machine learning is used in Web search, spam 垃圾邮件 filters, recommender systems, ad placement 放置, credit scoring, fraud 诈骗 detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. \n",
    "    * machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation [16].\n",
    "    * much of this folk knowledge 民间知识 is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article\n",

    "## Learning = representation + evaluation + optimization\n",
    "> ML 算法成千上万，为了简单梳理，它们主要包含以下几个模块：\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Representation**. A classifier must be represented in some formal language that the computer can handle.\n",
    "* [ML alg] This set is called the hypothesis space of the learner. If a classifier is not in the hypothesis space, it cannot be learned. \n",
    "* [Feature] A related question, which we will address in a later section, is how to represent the input, i.e., what features to use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> **Evaluation**. \n",
    "* An evaluation function (also called *objective function or scoring 得分 function*) is needed to distinguish good classifiers from bad ones.\n",
    "* [是这样的，以前碰到过] The evaluation function used internally 内部地 by the algorithm may differ from the external 外部的 one that we want the classifier to optimize,\n",
    "    * for ease of optimization (see below) \n",
    "    * and due to the issues discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Optimization**.\n",
    "* The choice of optimization technique is key to the efficiency of the learner, and also helps determine the classifier produced if the evaluation function has more than one optimum. \n",
    "* It is common for new learners to start out using off-the-shelf optimizers, which are later replaced by custom-designed ones.\n",
