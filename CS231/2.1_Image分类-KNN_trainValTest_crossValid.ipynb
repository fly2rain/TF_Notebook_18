    "If you wish to apply kNN in practice (hopefully not on images, or perhaps as only a baseline) proceed as follows:\n",
    "* Preprocess your data: Normalize the features in your data (e.g. one pixel in images) to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "    * We will cover this in more detail in later sections, and chose not to cover data normalization in this section because pixels in images are usually homogeneous (同质的) and do not exhibit widely different distributions, alleviating 减轻 the need for data normalization.  \n",
    "* If your data is very high-dimensional, consider using a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA or even [Random Projections 有意思哈](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).\n",
    "* If your kNN classifier is running too long, consider using an Approximate Nearest Neighbor library (e.g. FLANN) to accelerate the retrieval (at cost of some accuracy).\n",
    "* (非常有意思的问题) Take note of the hyperparameters that gave the best results. \n",
    "    * There is a question of whether you should use the full training set with the best hyperparameters, since the optimal hyperparameters might change if you were to fold the validation data into your training set (since the size of the data would be larger).\n",
    "    * In practice it is cleaner **to not use** the validation data in the final classifier and **consider it to be burned on estimating the hyperparameters**. Evaluate the best model on the test set. Report the test set accuracy and declare the result to be the performance of the kNN classifier on your data."
