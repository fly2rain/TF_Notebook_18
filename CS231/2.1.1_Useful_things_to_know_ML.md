# A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning
##### INFO
* Pedro Domingos

## Abstract
* **ML 原理、优势**：perform important tasks by **generalizing from examples**. **优势: feasible and cost-effective** where manual programming is not.
* **ML 潜力**：As more data becomes available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. 因此，ML 广泛应用于 CS  and other fields.
* **问题**：developing successful machine learning applications requires a **substantial amount of “black art”** that is hard to find in textbooks.
* **解决**：This article **summarizes twelve key lessons** that machine learning researchers and practitioners have learned. Including：(1) pitfalls 陷阱 to avoid, (2) important issues to focus on, (3) answers to common questions.

## Introduction
* Machine learning systems **automatically learn programs from data**. 
    * This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond.
    * Machine learning is used in Web search, spam 垃圾邮件 filters, recommender systems, ad placement 放置, credit scoring, fraud 诈骗 detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. 
    * machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation [16].
    * much of this folk knowledge 民间知识 is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article
* 本文将以 classification 为例介绍 skills，因为它是最成熟的 ML算法，但适用于所有 ML.
* spam filters 建模 (参照 introduction 第2段，有意思)
    * 原来 feature 是类似于 bag of words

## Learning = representation + evaluation + optimization
> ML 算法成千上万，为了简单梳理，它们主要包含以下几个模块：

> **Representation**. A classifier must be represented in some formal language that the computer can handle.
* [ML alg] This set is called the hypothesis space of the learner. If a classifier is not in the hypothesis space, it cannot be learned. 
* [Feature] A related question, which we will address in a later section, is how to represent the input, i.e., what features to use.
    
> **Evaluation**. 
* An evaluation function (also called *objective function or scoring 得分 function*) is needed to distinguish good classifiers from bad ones.
* [是这样的，以前碰到过] The evaluation function used internally 内部地 by the algorithm may differ from the external 外部的 one that we want the classifier to optimize,
    * for ease of optimization (see below) 
    * and due to the issues discussed in the next section.

> **Optimization**.
* The choice of optimization technique is key to the efficiency of the learner, and also helps determine the classifier produced if the evaluation function has more than one optimum. 
* It is common for new learners to start out using off-the-shelf optimizers, which are later replaced by custom-designed ones.
